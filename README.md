## Bemo Demo Application
- SCSS styling isnt my thing but i tried my best (Am not a UI person)
- Not a responsive design but i can improve
- Hosting provider does not allow saving of files on their serve, hence the 500 sever error page when trying to dump the database, a bemo.sql file can be seen in the root directory of my source to show that it was implemented
- Implementation of the DB dumper can be seen in the DBDumper Controller
- I am open and willing to improve
